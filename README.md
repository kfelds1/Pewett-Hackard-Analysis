# Pewett Hackard Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to compile the number of workers reaching retirement age at Pewlett Hackard as well as other statistics surrounding that, including their official work title, their birth dates, and their active work dates. Then, I used these data to determine which employees were eligible for a mentorship program. The goal of gathering this information is to help the company prepare for the "silver tsunami," or the collective retirement of many employees at once. The company will use this data to identify how many employees, as well as the title that they hold, will be retiring in the upcoming years.


## Results
- After creating the retiring_titles table, I was able to see which titles would have the most retiring employees and vice versa. It is evident that the senior positions will have the highest amount of retirees, as seen below. Additionally, staff and engineer positions at the company will also have a high demand as well once the employees retire. It is wuite shocking and interesting to see that the manager position only has two upcoming retirees.
